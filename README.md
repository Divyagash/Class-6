# Class-6
This repository contains the homework files that I used for 6.867 Machine Learning at MIT.
The Class had 3 homeworks and I did all of them in python and mostly using Jupyter notebook
DataFiles folder contains the data that is used in the homeworks either in .txt or .csv format. ImageFiles folder contains the images obtained from the algorithm or analysis method used.
